Let's face it! Trello is an amazing tool, but it can quickly become a nightmare when you're using it with your growing growing team. Trello's ["my cards" view](https://trello.com/me/cards) is about as useful as a box of broken hammers. That's why I built Burrito.

Burrito takes the cards to which you've been assigned and puts them in a simple, "to do" style list. You can search, filter by date, last activity, or alphabetically, and click to a specific Trello card without distracting boards or notifications.

## Privacy Statement
We respect that Trello holds sensitive data for your company. To ensure your privacy is respected, we've made our entire tool open source. We do not run any type of analytics or user behavior tracking in our project, and you or your organization can freely run your own copy. See [Running Locally](#running-locally) for more information.

## Running Locally
Burrito has a couple steps to get started running locally.

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Burrito requires an active [Font Awesome Pro](https://fontawesome.com) license to install the **Pro npm Packages**. Font Awesome has a great [guide for setting up the Font Awesome Pro license for npm/yarn](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/using-package-managers).
3. Open the directory in your terminal, and run `yarn local`.
